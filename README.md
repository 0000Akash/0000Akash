- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Akash
- I'm 18 years old.
I live in Bangladesh
- ðŸ‘€ I'm curious behind the scenes of blockchain. I am also working. I'm doing testnet in my spare time and trying to set up Node.
1 year ago I made my first attempt at testnets. and I've learned a lot so far
I've joined about 160+ testnets so far. I've tested many different platforms and networks. If you want to improve yourself, you can try the node codes in my profile.
I would also like to recommend a friend of mine who helped me a lot.
